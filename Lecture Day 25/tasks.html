<!-- <p>
  In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The
  population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new
  inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town
  need to see its population greater than or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?
  <br />

  At the end of the first year there will be: 1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070
  inhabitants
  <br />
  At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141
  inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)
  <br />

  At the end of the 3rd year there will be: 1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

  <br />
  It will need 3 entire years. More generally given parameters:
  <br />

  p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to
  equal or surpass)

  <br />
  the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a
  population greater or equal to p.
  <br />

  aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are
  positive integers (> 0)
  <br />

  Examples: nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15 nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000,
  2000000) -> 10 Note: Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a
  percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you
  have to convert it to 0.02.
  <br />

  There are no fractions of people. At the end of each year, the population
  count is an integer: 252.8 people round down to 252 persons.

<!-- <p>
  If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
  get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
  <br />

  Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5
  below the number passed in.
  <br />

  Additionally, if the number is negative, return 0.
  <br />

  Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
