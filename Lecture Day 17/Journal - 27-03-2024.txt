Ive Started this course in the first week of march 2024 and today is 27th march 2024
We have learned more about git and github today
weve learned about github branches, creating branches, publishing branches, pages,
 how to online a web through pages,
and what are some of the possible errors in that, mergins two branches and what to 
keep in mind while merging the branches to main branch.
its 11 02 am now and the lecture is still pending while i am working on this journal 
all the other students are strugling to make a page online
what ive done 3 days ago and just revised it today (but ive learned some more things today).
meanwhile i helped a fellow student to make a webpage online through github.com.
and a strange thing in all this that a fellow female student is watching makeup totural and youtube shorts while
she should be doing practice to make pages online or merging branches /* Strange :D*/.
